# Servo16_3 added-PIR
# Webrobotix Servo Controller Servo16_3_PIR (Processing / Arduino)

This Processing sketch provides a **16-channel RC servo controller interface** with sequence recording and Arduino sketch export.  
It communicates with an Arduino running the **Servo18_sketch_PIR and optionally supports the **Adafruit 16-Channel 12-bit PWM/Servo Shield**.

**This software is provided for educational and experimental purposes only. The author assumes no responsibility for any damage or injury resulting from its use.**
---

 **Features**

- Control up to **16 RC servos** using sliders and buttons.
- Toggle individual servos active/inactive.
- Define servo limits (**min, max, center**) and save them to files.
- Label servos for easier identification.
- Record **servo sequences** using keyframes with speed and delay.
- Play back recorded sequences in real time.
- Export recorded sequences as **Arduino sketches**:
  - Standard `Servo.h` version.
  - PWM shield version (`Adafruit_PWMServoDriver`).
- Save and load all servo settings (limits, labels, active states) to unified settings files.
- Auto-reconnect and monitoring of Arduino serial ports.
- Easing function for smooth, lifelike motion.

---

 **Requirements**

- [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/) (tested with 4.4.0).
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- Arduino board (Uno, Nano, etc.) running `Servo17_sketch` (no EEPROM version).
- (Optional) [Adafruit 16-Channel 12-bit PWM/Servo Shield](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1411).

Processing Libraries:
- `processing.serial.*` (included by default).

---

 **Setup**

1. Upload the Arduino firmware (`Servo17_sketch`) to your Arduino.
2. Connect servos to your Arduino pins (or PWM shield channels).
3. Open this sketch in Processing and run it.
4. The program will auto-scan serial ports and connect to your Arduino.
5. Use the UI to control servos, save settings, or record sequences.

 **User Interface**

- **Sliders (per servo):** Move servo between 0°–180°.
- **Buttons (per servo):**
  - `Active` – toggle servo control.
  - `Center` – move to stored center.
  - `Set Ctr` – set current position as center.
  - `Set Min` / `Set Max` – define limits.
  - `Reset` – restore default 0°–180°, center 90°.
  - `Label` – rename servo.
- **Global Controls:**
  - `All Active` / `All Inactive`.
  - `Connect` – force reconnection to Arduino.
- **Settings Controls:**
  - `Save Settings` – save limits/labels to file.
  - `Load Settings` – load from file.
  - `Delete Settings` – remove a saved file.
- **Sequence Panel:**
  - `Record` – toggle recording.
  - `Add Frame` – save current servo positions.
  - `Play` – run sequence.
  - `Clear` – remove all frames.
  - `Export` – generate Arduino sketch.
  - **Sliders** for movement speed (ms) and delay (ms).
- **PWM Shield Toggle:** Switch between Standard Servo Library and PWM Shield modes.

**Hotkeys:**
- `R` – toggle recording  
- `K` – add keyframe  
- `P` – play sequence  
- `C` – clear sequence  
- `S` – toggle PWM shield  

---

 **File Management**

- Settings are saved as `data/<name>_settings.txt`.
- Unified format stores **servo limits, states, and labels** together.
- Old legacy formats (`servo_settings.txt`, `servo_labels.txt`) still load.

Exported Arduino sketches are saved as:
data/<sketchName>_StandardServo_FIXED.ino
data/<sketchName>_PWMShield_FIXED.ino

---

 **Exported Arduino Sketch**

The exported `.ino` file includes:
- Smooth motion control using millis() (non-blocking).
- Easing function (`easeInOutCubic`) for natural servo transitions.
- Accurate handling of speed + delay per keyframe.
- Support for either **Standard Servo Library** or **Adafruit PWM Shield**.

---

 **Quick Start Example**

Here’s a step-by-step workflow to go from servo setup to an exported sketch:

1. **Connect and Activate Servos**
   - Run the Processing sketch.
   - Click `Connect` if it doesn’t auto-connect.
   - Use `All Active` or press individual `Active` buttons to enable servos.

2. **Set Servo Ranges**
   - Move a slider to the minimum desired position → press `Set Min`.
   - Move it to the maximum desired position → press `Set Max`.
   - Move to neutral and press `Set Ctr` (optional).
   - Save your setup with `Save Settings`.

3. **Record a Sequence**
   - Click `Record` (or press `R`).
   - Move servos to desired positions with sliders.
   - Press `Add Frame` (or `K`) to capture that position with timing.
   - Adjust `Movement Speed` and `Delay` sliders as needed.
   - Add more frames to build your sequence.
   - Stop recording when finished.

4. **Playback**
   - Click `Play` (or `P`) to test the sequence in real time.

5. **Export for Arduino**
   - Click `Export`, enter a sketch name.
   - Choose either **Standard Servo** or **PWM Shield** mode.
   - A `.ino` file will be saved under `data/`.
   - Open it in Arduino IDE, upload to your board, and your sequence runs standalone.
